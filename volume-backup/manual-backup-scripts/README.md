# Manual Backup Scripts for Docker Volumes

This directory contains scripts to facilitate manual backup and restoration of Docker volumes associated with Coolify instances.

These scripts are initially copied from the Coolify documentation about "Migrate Applications to Another Coolify Host".

Read also more about backup and restore of Coolify instances itself (without the applications data).
